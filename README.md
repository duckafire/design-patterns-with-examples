# Design patterns with examples

In summary, Design Patterns are solutions already tested to recurrent
problems in programming, that aim to facilitate a project maintenance and
understanding.

The purpose of this project is to introduce the main types of Design
Pattern in programming, ina simple, easy and didactic way.

The patterns were separated in distinct files, being formed by a short
description (in top) and by executable code (that makes use of the pattern).
The concept of the code can be adapted to a lot of programming languages.

> [!WARNING]
> It is worth remembering, even though it is useful, these patterns will not
> fit perfectly in all types of project and programming languages, so it is
> up to you to analyze and decide what it should be used and what should not
> be used.

## Gang of Four (GoF)

It is a group of authors of the book
[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software][gof-book],
formed by [Erich Gamma][erich], [Richard Helm][richard], [Ralph Johnson][ralph]
and [John Vlissibes][jhon]. Their book is a catalog of Design Pattern, with
usage instructions, descriptions and tips related to the patterns in this section.
